## What is this and who is it for ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

I have been a member of my favorite tech community in Vietnam since I was a student in Vietnam. It's [WeBuild community](https://webuild.community/), formerly known as Ruby Vietnam. 

Here, we have many active users on our slack, and a user named "@C·∫≠u L√†m V∆∞·ªùn".

He just said, a new year with a new journey as he started new learning series in this slack.

Instead of saving all the posts on the channel, I thought why I could create my collection as I did in my notion. Be humble and share your learning; I made this repo and the [web app](http://31daysofsharing.com/) store all learning things from #30daysofsharing.

I hope this resource will be helpful for you on your learning journey. I will try my best to keep this repository update.
