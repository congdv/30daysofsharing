Before:
```
setInterval(function foo() {
  doStuff();
}, 1000);
```

After:
```
function foo() {
  doStuff();
  setTimeout(foo, 1000);
}
foo();
```

or, you know, use requestAnimationFrame :D

Why? To avoid event stacking (e.g. when browsers put your page into idle state and wake it up back. See: http://jsfiddle.net/s7uec8g1/ for an example)
