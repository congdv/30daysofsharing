In most cases it would go like this: you use useRef to store a reference to a DOM element, and useState to store an "immutable" value that should trigger a re-render. However, this is more like the outcomes. Duo to the underlying mechanism of these 2 hooks, you can achieve much more advanced use cases if you know what you are doing.
```
const [button, setButton] = useState<HTMLButtonElement | null>(null);
return <button ref={setButton} />
```
This actually works due to the fact that React's special "ref" prop can receive a callback (remember the "callback ref" concept anyone?), and a setState is basically a callback to set a value, isn't it?

The thing is, when would this be useful? When should you use useState for reference instead of useRef? The key here is that useState triggers a re-render, and useRef does not. So you would use useState when you want a re-render to happen (or to be specific, all the hooks that happen in a re-render to run) when you got a reference to an element (i.e. after it's mounted to the real tree). This is usually seen when the target element is rendered conditionally or it may be replaced later.

This is not actually uncommon. One of the most popular positioning library, PopperJS, use this approach so they can re-calculate the position correctly after having known the rendered target element [https://popper.js.org/react-popper/v2/](https://popper.js.org/react-popper/v2/)
