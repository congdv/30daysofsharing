This may be a little bit personal, but you know what grinds my gears? Having to switched to js/json configuration files while working in the comfort world of TypeScript. I was pretty spoiled and feeling uneasy when having no autocompletion or inlined linting when writing configuration files (and some configs do feel like source code).

Fortunately, there is not just one, but two ways to solve this!

1. **The JSON-Schema way**: JSON Schemas are basically typing for JSON files, and fortunately some editors like VSCode have built-in support for many common JSON config format: [https://www.schemastore.org/json/](https://www.schemastore.org/json/) (in fact, if you are a library author you can even add your own there!).

To have this, simply name your JSON config correctly (e.g. .prettierrc.json). In fact, this should already be done because if not then the tool itself just won't work anyway.

2. The JSDoc way: Funny thing, some editors (again, like VSCode) use the `@type` of JSDoc to try to suggest the shape of some objects, and what's even more fun is that you can "import" TypeScript's declaration here!

For example:
```
/** @type {import("rollup-plugin-postcss").PostCSSPluginConf } */
const postcssOptions = {
	plugins: /* you will get autocomplete here! */
}
```
Have fun writing safer code!
